At this point the following should work. If you're done,
install a Java Linter on your editor of choice.

```
java -version
javac -help
```

## Java

#### What is it?

An object-oriented programming language. It is compiled to bytecode
which can then run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

#### Why is it rad?

* Statically typed, which ensures functions return a certain type
  of result. This catches bugs early on in the process.
* Compiled to bytecode which can then be run on any JVM regardless
  of computer architecture.
* It's super popular and can gain you entry to lots of companies.

#### Why is it not rad?

* Owned by Oracle.
* Very verbose compared to other languages.
* Requires compilation which can be kind of slow.

## I Do

Write a basic HelloWorld class. Output some text to the screen.

#### Checks for Understanding

* What is `void` doing?
* What do you expect to happen if we change `void` to
  a different type?
* What is required to run a simple Java program?
  * A main method
  * Compile with `javac`
  * Run with `java`


## We Do

Let's make a simple Aloof class that makes something we say
more aloof. For example:

`I love rain >> I love rain, I guess...`

* Create a new class called Aloof.
* Create a main function.
* Let's talk about "args" -- we will go over this
  soon but it's an array of strings. It will take
  arguments we pass in and put them into an array.
* Access the first item in the array and print it out
  along with ", I guess..."

#### Checks for Understanding

* What is args?
  * An array of arguments passed in after running the java file.
* How can you access values in arrays in Java?
  * With bracket notation!


## You Do

Go through the syntax section up until Arrays (we'll cover that
after lunch). We'll come back together at 11:15am to go over some
of what we learned.


## Re-group

#### Checks for Understanding

* What is the difference between an instance and class method?
  * Class methods can be called internally (and off the class).
  * Instance methods require an instance to be created first.
